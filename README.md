# Pong
It's just Pong.. my first unity project. It was harder than I thought. Still fun. Learned a lot. especially larp. I heard of it but now know what to do with it I think. Either way going to work on this and add features. But going to move on to another project. Don't know what it's going to be yet, but it'll be better than this I hope.
